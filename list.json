        "bio": "<span>Beth Kindig is the CEO and Lead Tech Analyst for the I/O Fund and Tech Insider Network, delivering weekly in-depth tech stock analysis to her free newsletter subscribers. </span><br><br>Tech Insider Network is unique in that we blend real tech industry experience with active portfolio management. We pioneered combining cutting-edge fundamentals with high-performing technical analysis for retail.<span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We have beat top-performing Wall Street funds across four periods, </span><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230323005068/en/IO-Fund-Cumulative-Returns-Double-the-Nasdaq-Following-a-Tough-2022\">including our most recent audit proving</a><span> a lead of up to 174% compared to other verified all-tech portfolios. You will notice the vast majority of retail sites are not verified at all, which is one of the many ways the I/O Fund raises the bar. Premium Members can access more information </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1326-tech-insider-network/articles/5856648-2022-full-year-audited-returns\">regarding our 2022 performance here</a><span>.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Our audited results prove we are one of the best-performing tech portfolios since our inception. Our cumulative returns since inception are 46.92% – which is more than double the Nasdaq-100’s return of 18.65%. Notably, this was achieved during a risk-of environment when indexes typically outperform individual portfolios.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Tech Insider Network offers three full-time analysts with real-time trade alerts, an actively managed portfolio, institutional-level deep dives, PLUS a hedging service for an unbeatable price.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Our Advanced Market Signals service is $799 per year, which works out to having a team of analysts for only pennies per hour. </span><span>Our New Tech Insider Network Essentials Plan at $99/year works out to fractions of a penny per hour.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Our team is frequently featured in Tier 1 News. This includes Fox Business News, CNBC, TD Ameritrade and more. Media is the ultimate gatekeeper on quality and these spots are typically exclusively reserved for institutional analysts. You can view dozens of appearances on our YouTube channel.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>There's plenty of opinions on tech and no shortage of coverage. In contrast, Tech Insider Network is an audited portfolio that outperforms other all-tech portfolios. Our audited portfolio results are published online in BusinessWire.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We were the first service to offer specialized tech sector coverage that combines fundamentals and technicals. After recommending a stock, we continually provide new entries and exits. The difference is that we don’t pump out meaningless content. Rather, everything we write is actionable and tied to a real, live portfolio. Sometimes, we say “don’t buy right now” or “wait for a lower entry.” This also led to a successful hedge of up to 100% of our portfolio in 2022.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span> <span>OFFICIAL BIO:</span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span>Beth Kindig has twelve years of experience in competitive and product analysis in the tech industry dating back to 2011. Considering tech growth stocks took off after the financial crisis, she is a veteran in every sense of the word.</span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span>Her tech conference appearances date back to 2014 and her analysis began garnering press in the same year. She is known for making bold calls on tech stocks and offers a weekly free newsletter that leverages her ten years of experience in the private markets. Her newsletter has seen gains of up to 403% in three years.</span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span>It is not only the big gains she has achieved with individual stocks but also the quality and consistency of her analysis and how she carefully forms her theses that have placed Beth on the map as one of the best tech analysts in the market.</span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span>She has formed a proven methodology of choosing the right investments from being exposed to hundreds of tech growth companies over the past 10 years.</span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span><br></span></span><span><span>This is not a methodology that the traditionally trained can learn or repeat. Kindig has spoken at many tech conferences including the Android Developers Conference, GamesBeat, Advertising Week NYC, Tech Week Chicago, and BlackHat. She has been published in Forbes, MarketWatch, Venture Beat, MediaPost, AdExchanger, and the International Association of Privacy Professionals. She has appeared on Fox Business News, CNBC, TDAmeritrade, CoinDesk, NPR, Bloomberg TV Asia, Motley Fool podcast, This Week in Startups and more discussing her stock analysis.</span></span>",
